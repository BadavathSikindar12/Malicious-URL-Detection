 
ðŸ”Ž Malicious URL Detection

This project focuses on detecting malicious URLs using Machine Learning.  
Malicious URLs are commonly used in phishing, malware distribution, and defacement attacks.  
The goal is to classify a given URL as Benign (safe) or Malicious (phishing, defacement, etc.).

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- Objective: Build a machine learning model to detect malicious URLs.  
- Dataset: A labeled dataset of URLs with categories such as:
  - Benign
  - Phishing
  - Defacement
  - Malware
- Methodology:
  - Feature extraction from URLs (length, entropy, domain, subdomains, symbols, etc.)
  - Data preprocessing and encoding
  - Training ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, etc.)
  - Model evaluation with performance metrics
